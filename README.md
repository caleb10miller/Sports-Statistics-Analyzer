# Sports-Statistics-Analyzer
I completed this java project for my CS501 class at Drexel University. I created a way to input sports statistics for multiple types of athletes: Football and Basketball Players. This project showcases an understanding of classes and how they interact with each other (is-a / has-a relationships) and data input validation.
